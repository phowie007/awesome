Hi gorgeous :)
It took a couple of days to learn this github bizness, but I think I've got it figured out.

How are you?  I've just started to get my head around this tour gig.  I've got a contract on its way to me in the mail and a shiny new ACT (Associated Crafts and Technician) card (AKA "Anyone Can Tour") card on its way to me as well.  Basically I'll eventually be holding two IATSE memberships: one in the Wardrobe Union in CA and one in the Hair and Makeup Union in New York.  I feel like the coolest kid on the block :)

How is the Chevron project/work treating you? I sent your road box/wig dryer idea to Brandon (my boss) and he was thrilled. 

Catch me up on you when you have a minute.  I'm totally enjoying learning this new software.  One of my clients is learning it too - he is not as far along as I am, so hopefully as I am learning more from you I can help him too.

Thank you for being amazing every day, sweetheart.  I am so incredibly glad you are in my life.
