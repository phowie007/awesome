Hi gorgeous :)

It took a couple of days to learn this github bizness, but I think I've got it figured out!!

How are you?  I've just started to get my head around this tour gig.  The packing boxes and sorting clothes process has begun, and I have found a great new home for the kittens.  One of my clients and her husband, who have a very old cat, wants to take them and see if they will liven up the old guy, and if not, they might put the old cat down and just have my two.

I am going to head for NYC on March 27 - 30 to watch the show with Brandon and get some of the backstage tracks in my head.  This means that I will be sending you lots of choreography to play around with very soon :)  Some of the Broadway tracks will have to be condensed because we will not have as many crew as they do on Broadway, so that will be a fun challenge as well.  Then I'll land in your favorite city for the next 20 weeks.  yay!

Thank you for being amazing every day, sweetheart.  Your continued support and encouragement are the best gift imaginable.  
I am so incredibly glad you are in my life.
